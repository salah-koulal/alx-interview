# Prime Game

If there's more than one prime number available, try to remove a prime that leaves an even number of composite numbers (multiples of primes) remaining. This gives your opponent an odd number of composite numbers. Even with optimal play, they will be forced to leave you at least one prime to pick up on your next turn.
If there's only one prime number left, you have no choice but to take it.
